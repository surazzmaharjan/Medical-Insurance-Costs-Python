For this project, 
We will be investigating a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file using 
the Python skills that you have developed. This dataset and its parameters will 
seem familiar if you have done any of the previous Python projects in the data science path.

However, doing tasked with working with the actual information in the dataset and performing your own 
independent analysis on real-world data! We will not be providing step-by-step instructions on what to do, but we will provide you with a framework to structure your exploration and analysis.

Prerequisites:
Python Fundamentals
